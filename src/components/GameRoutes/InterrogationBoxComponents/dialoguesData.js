            "Let me think… Last Saturday… Ah yes, that weekend my wife took the kids to visit their grandparents for a few days, but I stayed home. *rubbing his nose*",
            "Can anyone confirm that?",

            "You’re not in the position to hide things from me, Harry. You're a coke head and you just told me you have a mistress. What will your wife do if she finds out about all this, huh?",

            "Anyway, let's end this investigation quickly, I have an appointment in an hour.",

            "Sounds more suitable..",
            "Well, I’ll start by asking about your relationship with Jimmy. Did you keep in touch with him after the breakup?",
            "Okay, that sounds painful for me, but no, we didn't talk at all after the relationship ended.",
            "Was it easy for you?",
            "Not at all, I loved him and he was everything to me. But one doesn’t have a choice with cheaters.",
            "Oh, I see. So what do you think he wanted when he texted you on the day he was murdered?",
             "I don't know. After the relationship ended, he completely ghosted me. So it was strange that he suddenly contacted me again, especially since I'm already in a new relationship.",
             "That is strange. Did he know about your new relationship with Harry?",
             "He didn’t and I think I should go. Are there many questions left?",

             "Well, why did you ask to meet your new boyfriend?  And did you tell him about Jimmy's messages?",
             "Yes, I told him because it was strange and I didn't feel comfortable.",
             "Maybe your boyfriend got angry at Jimmy and decided to kill him?",
             "Not at all. He was not angry and tried to calm me down and told me let's meet now and forget about it.",
             "So you were at Harry's place the whole time?",
             "Yes, I spent the night there, but we didn't talk about Jimmy. He just told me to forget it. I think Jimmy had problems with a drug dealer named Piotr and he owed him a lot of money because of drugs, maybe Piotr killed him.",
             "Who is Piotr? What do you know about him?",
              "Sorry, I have to go. I'm late. But you can find Piotr in Bar 66. That's all I know.",

            "Not much, I'm afraid, but I did go to Bar 66 and talked to Piotr. Found out something interesting while I was there. Maybe you can help me figure it out.",
            "Ha! I was sure he knew something. Well, what did that son of a bitch tell you?",
            "He mentioned someone called Honey-Bunny. Have you ever heard of that name before?",
            "Honey-Bunny? No, It doesn't ring a bell. That's a weird name, though. Maybe it's some sort of a code word between them. Did he say something else??",
            "No, it’s not a code word. Honey-Bunny is a woman. Piotr described her as this hot Asian chick.",
            "What?! A hot Asian chick??!! I knew it. That bastard was a deceitful cheater.",
            "Errr.. Sorry that you had to find out this way. I thought maybe you know something about her.",
            "Don't worry, I don't care about this cheater at all. I'm the one who’s sorry because I don't know anything about this bitch.",
            "Don't worry about it! We'll continue with the investigation and we won't stop until we get to the perpetrator. Thanks anyway for your time.",
            "Yeah, sure... Wait a minute, I think you should ask Jimmy's mom, Iris. He really trusted her and visited her constantly. Maybe she knows who this Honey-Bunny is.",
            "Oh, thanks for the tip! I was already planning to visit her anyway, so now is probably the right time to do it.",
            "I guess it's time for me to leave. It was nice meeting you again. I hope you keep me updated. Bye!",
