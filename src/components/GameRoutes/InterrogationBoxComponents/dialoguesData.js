            "Let me think… Last Saturday… Ah yes, that weekend my wife took the kids to visit their grandparents for a few days, but I stayed home. *rubbing his nose*",
            "Can anyone confirm that?",
            "Well, I was home alone, but you can ask my wife. I swear I had nothing to do with Jimmy’s death! *rubbing his nose*",

            "You better talk! Right Now! Or I’m arresting you for drug possession.",
            "Ok, look! I’ve been seeing this girl. Her name’s Buffy. She’s Jimmy’s ex. She came over to my place that night, so I was with her the whole time. She might know something about the murder. Why don’t you ask her?",
            "You’re not in the position to hide things from me, Harry. You're a coke head and you just told me you have a mistress. What will your wife do if she finds out about all this, huh?",
            "Son of a bitch! Fine! She wrote me last Saturday saying that Jimmy texted her out of the blue and asked her to go over to his place.",

            "Sounds more suitable..",
            "Well, I’ll start by asking about your relationship with Jimmy. Did you keep in touch with him after the breakup?",

            "Was it easy for you?",
            "Not at all, I loved him and he was everything to me. But one doesn’t have a choice with cheaters.",
            "Oh, I see. So what do you think he wanted when he texted you on the day he was murdered?",
             "I don't know. After the relationship ended, he completely ghosted me. So it was strange that he suddenly contacted me again, especially since I'm already in a new relationship.",
             "That is strange. Did he know about your new relationship with Harry?",
             "He didn’t and I think I should go. Are there many questions left?",

             "Maybe your boyfriend got angry at Jimmy and decided to kill him?",
             "Not at all. He was not angry and tried to calm me down and told me let's meet now and forget about it.",
             "So you were at Harry's place the whole time?",
             "Yes, I spent the night there, but we didn't talk about Jimmy. He just told me to forget it. I think Jimmy had problems with a drug dealer named Piotr and he owed him a lot of money because of drugs, maybe Piotr killed him.",
             "Who is Piotr? What do you know about him?",
              "Sorry, I have to go. I'm late. But you can find Piotr in Bar 66. That's all I know.",
